    <h1>Miniature Chihuahua puppies</h1>

<p>The Chihuahua breed is famous for being the smallest dog in the world, but at the same time, the biggest personality is hidden inside this tiny dog. This is more than a person, she is very popular with all people of all ages, men and women, and especially children.</p>
 <p>Despite the small size of the Chihuahua, like all dogs, it needs games and training. The amount of energy an adult Chihuahua has can be surprising. He will endlessly chase squirrels in the yard and is ready to play as long as you can. Your Chihuahua will enjoy walks, play noisy games around your yard, and run around with toys. They will run until they collapse from exhaustion, so it is important to make sure they do not tire themselves out too much, especially on hot summer days.</p>
